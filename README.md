Fireworks BOOMING and BOOMING
I hope you guys are having a great Christmas with your friends and families. I make this website just for you guys to see the fireworks and chill out during the Christmas and New Year season. We all have worked hard last year and we all deserved some moments to relax and chill.
I made this mainly with html, css, and javascript and it is pretty easy to do as well. I also attach a christmas song there for you guys to play as well. Press on the play button and the song will be played. I really love that song, so remember to play it and just gives yourselves a moment to chill!!!
